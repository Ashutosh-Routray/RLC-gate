            <br><br>
            <div class="whatwhyhow-info">GATE stands for Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering. It is conducted jointly by IISc and seven IITs.<br> It tests the subject knowledge in the branch of engineering of the candidate's choice.<br><br>  The following are some facts about GATE:<br><br>

              <span>Eligibility:</span> B.E/B.Tech graduates and final year students are eligible to write GATE<br><br>
              
              <span>Calender:</span> The exam is held in 1st/2nd week of February.<br><br>
              
              <span>Duration:</span> 3 hours<br><br>
              
              <span>Question paper pattern: </span>The paper is for 100 marks. There will be 65 questions, out of which 55 are subject based questions and 10 are about aptitude and comprehension. Each question carries either 1 mark or 2 marks.<br><br>
              
              <span>Negative marking:</span> There is negative marking for multiple choice questions. For wrong answers, 1/3 mark will be subtracted for a 1 mark question, and 2/3 will be subtracted for a 2 mark question. There is no negative marking for fill-in-the-blanks questions.<br><br>

          <br><br>
          <div class="whatwhyhow-info">
            A valid GATE score opens up many opportunities. The following are the main options after writing the GATE exam.<br><br>

<span>1. PG programs at IISc and IITs</span><br>
With a very good rank in GATE, one has the “dream option” of joining IISc or IITs for postgraduate studies. In addition to the M.E/M.Tech courses, one can also join for the research programs (M.Sc(engg.)/PhD). The selected candidates get a monthly stipend. Top institutes like TIFR and IIIT also use GATE score in their admission process. Many of the NITs also have very good postgraduate programs, and one needs to have a very good GATE score to join those courses. More details here.<br><br>

<span>2. PG programs at other Institutes</span><br>
Among those who join postgraduate programs at other colleges (private or government), only those with a valid GATE score get the monthly stipend.<br><br>

<span>3. Job opportunities</span><br>
Many public sector companies, like BARC, NTPC, IOC, ONGC, CEL etc., now consider GATE score as a parameter in their recruitment process. In many of these companies, candidates with good GATE scores are directly called for interview.<br><br>

<span>4. PG programs at universities abroad</span><br>
Many universities abroad, like NSU (Singapore) etc., consider GATE score in their admission process.<br><br>

<span>5. Quest for excellence</span><br>
Beyond all these opportunities that open up with a good GATE score, there is a more fundamental reason for writing the GATE exam. It is the standard barometer of your competence in your chosen field. It tests the depth of your understanding of the subjects that you have studied. It measures how far you have traveled in your quest for excellence. A good GATE score does your confidence a world of good! And the sense of achievement and happiness a top GATE score gives you cannot be matched!<br><br>

        <div class="whatwhyhow-head">How to excel in GATE?</div>
        <br><br>
        <div class="whatwhyhow-info">
<br><br>
There is a widespread notion that GATE is not easy to crack, and that it is very difficult to get a good score in GATE. Is this true?<br><br>

The answer is an emphatic NO!. You only need proper preparation to excel in GATE. You don’t need to be a genius to get a rank under 100. You only need to be smart enough to prepare properly, along with a strong motivation towards excellence.<br><br>

For an excellent performance in GATE, two things are essential:<br><br>

<span>A comprehensive understanding of concepts</span> and
<span>Extensive practice</span><br><br>
Let us consider the importance of concepts with a simple example:<br><br>

<div class="md">The power of the signal x(t)=2 cos100<span style="color:red;">π</span><span style="color:blue;">t</span>-5 sin100<span style="color:red;">π</span><span style="color:blue;">t</span> is _____________</div>
<br>

The question is quite straightforward. To answer this question, you need to know the following concepts:<br>
<span>Power of a sinusoid</span> <br>
<span>Orthogonality of sin and cosine signals of the same frequency</span><br>
<span>Power of a sum of orthogonal signals</span> <br><br>
If you know these three concepts, the answer is direct. You’d probably have encountered such questions in your tests/exams. Now consider the next example:<br><br>
<div class="md">The power of the signal x(t)=2 cos100<span style="color:red;">π</span><span style="color:blue;">t</span>-5sin[(100<span style="color:red;">π</span><span style="color:blue;">t</span>-<span style="color:red;">π</span>/3)] is _____________</div>
<br>
<!-- The power of the signal x(t)=2 cos100πt-5sin[(100πt-π/3)] is _____________<br><br> -->

This question adds phase shift as a new parameter to the previous question. Now we cannot add the powers of the two components of x(t) directly. To answer this question, you need to know<br><br>

The formula for sin(A-B), so that <span>x(t)</span> can be expressed once again in terms of orthogonal components, or<br><br>
Phasor diagram


Thus, the second question adds something extra to the first one, to make it more challenging. This is typical of GATE questions. In fact, the same concept can be tested in a broader context.<br><br> Consider the following example:<br><br>

The signal <span>x(t)=cos100πt+2 sin[(120πt-π/3)]</span> is SSB-USB modulated, with both the in-phase and quadrature carriers having an amplitude of 3V. The power of the modulated signal is ____________<br><br>

To answer this question, you should know<br><br>

Whether the two components of <span>x(t)</span> are orthogonal<br><br>
To calculate the power of <span>x(t)</span>, and the relation between the power of the message signal and modulated signal in SSB, or<br><br>
To plot the power spectrum of the modulated signal and find its power.<br><br>
From the examples discussed, we can make some observations:<br><br>

A typical GATE question requires you to know many different concepts.<br><br>
You should also know how to connect the different concepts together to get the correct answer. This is where practice helps.<br><br>
Concepts in fundamental subjects like signals and systems form the basis of those in advanced subjects like communication. So you need to have a proper focus on fundamental subjects.<br><br>
